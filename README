## Constraints Satisfied
- Classes in 9-6
- Classes in 5-6 pm to only those residing in campus
- Max 4 days teaching to ALL
- CCC in afternoon only
- UWE choices based on Class Representatives responses
    - First year choices are mostly ignored.

- Labs mostly later in the day. But some labs in morning were unavoidable. 


## Constraints NOT Satisfied
- 90 minutes class could not be fit into Tuesdays-Thursdays only
- Same day class not back to back. Gaps possible.
- ECO101 removed from the software. To be done by guest faculty on Friday and Saturday.
- ECO367 removed from the software. To be done by guest faculty on Friday and Saturday.
- ECO411 removed from the software. To be done by guest faculty on Friday and Saturday.

- EED102 - removed from TT because 8 am class was requested. Can be scheduled manually.
- SHSS slotting of non-overlapping courses seems like a mathematical impossbility. There are about 10 courese in each slot. Which becomes 40 hours. But we have only 35 hours in a week.
